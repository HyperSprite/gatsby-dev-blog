This is a tech blog about things I am working on or find interesting. I should have started it years ago. I didn't, so I am starting it now.


This blog is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with the [Minimal blog](https://github.com/LeKoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) starter and hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). All photos are my own.
