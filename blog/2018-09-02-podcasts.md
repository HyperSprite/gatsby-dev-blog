## Current


- [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm): Michael Jackson and Chantasitic present this who's who of the React community talking about the React ecosystem. There are a lot of origin stories which I find inspiring as well as thoughts about why particular libraries were created the way they were. Of note, episode [22: Promise Accessibility with Ryan Florence](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/22) where he talks about accessibility.
- [Leadville 100 Podcast (MTB)](http://www.leadville100podcast.com/): While there is no free ride, Elden 'Fatty" Nelson, Michael 'Hottie' Hotten and guests bring you vital tips and tricks from years of experience to help you get your finishers buckle at the Leadville 100 MTB race.
- [TrainerRoad 'Ask a Cycling Coach' Podcast](https://www.trainerroad.com/podcast): Nate, Chad, and Jonathan come at you every week with tips to improve your cycling and triathlon performance. Even if you don't use their software (which is awesome) or ride indoors, there is still something in every episode to help you get faster.


## Past


- [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com): Malcolm Gladwell covers things often misunderstood in recent history.
- [TalkScript](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/category/podcast/): The Sitepen podcast lives on the lighter side of code and I find it hysterical at times.
